# K-Adapter Reimplementation

```
Disclaimer: This implementation is not related to the original paper and has simply been rewritten since I needed to use it and the original codebase was ... messy.
```

This is a clean reimplementation of the K-Adapter paper ("K-Adapter: Infusing Knowledge into Pre-Trained Models with Adapters", R. Wang et al.).

## Requirements

Python 3.8 \
For used packages, see requirements.txt \
And yes, the would have looked a little better if I had used Python 3.9 or 3.10, but this way it is compatible to more setups.

## Usage

See Usage.ipynb for general usage information.
